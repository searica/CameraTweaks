# CameraTweaks
Client-side mod that lets you set the maximum distance you can zoom out to when on foot or in a boat.

## Instructions
If you are using a mod manager for Thunderstore simply install the mod from there. If you are not using a mod manager then, you need a modded instance of Valheim with BepInEx installed and to put the dll file for this mod into the plugins folder of BepInEx.

## Configuration
Changes made to the configuration settings will be reflected in-game immediately (no restart required). The mod also has a built in file watcher so you can edit settings via an in-game configuration manager (changes applied upon closing the in-game configuration manager) or by changing values in the file via a text editor or mod manager.

### Global Section:

**Verbosity**
- Low will log basic information about the mod. Medium will log information that is useful for troubleshooting. High will log a lot of information, do not set it to this without good reason as it will slow down your game.
  - Acceptable values: Low, Medium, High
  - Default value: Low.

### Camera Section

**MaxDistance**
- Maximum distance you can zoom out to. Vanilla default is 6.
    - Default value: 6

**MaxDistanceBoat**
- Maximum distance you can zoom out to while in a boat. Vanilla default is 6.
    - Default value: 12
